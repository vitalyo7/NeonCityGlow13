Dream TV facility 
---------------------------
A pre WW3 facility that ran psychological experiments on the effects of AI
and viral marketing. Producing content from mining social media in hopes of 
creating content that is easy to market. In reality the content became 
darker and darker as the AI learned and prowled the pre-matrix information
highway, until it started resembling something out of the darkest
nightmares, emotionally scaring young people and adults alike.

Abandonded semi automated android actors still roam the facility recycling
lines from learned word soup and acting out some gibberish auto generated scenario. 
In some ways WW3 did humanity a favor by shutting this nightmare manufacturer for good.

FEMA Pandemic Facility
----------------------
A secret government facility that was built below ground
(above a generic farm), that is designed to act as a emergency research 
and command station in case of a dangerous disease outbrake in the US. 
The facility has an AI that monitors equipment, doors, as well as 
environmental controls. Should the facility be compromised and AI
detects an outbreak, the facility is equipped with chemical and 
nuclear fail-safe device. The facility has state of the art (pre WW3)
medical and scientific equipment, automated laser defence system and
various storage that hosts spare parts, medical and food supplies to
allow autonomous function for up to two years.

The facility was used to host some scientist during WW3 but their fate
post WW3 remains unknown. The facility is still up and runing with 
a cold fusion reactor and a functioning AI. Penetrating the facility may be
difficult due to it deep underground and having multiple blast doors, traps
and obstacles. Given that this was one of the top facilities, some of the
equipment and research may still be of value.
