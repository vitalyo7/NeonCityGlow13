Dream TV facility 
---------------------------
A pre WW3 facility that ran psychological experiments on the effects of AI
and viral marketing. Producing content from mining social media in hopes of 
creating content that is easy to market. In reality the content became 
darker and darker as the AI learned and prowled the pre-matrix information
highway, until it started resembling something out of the darkest
nightmares, emotionally scaring young people and adults alike.

Abandonded semi automated android actors still roam the facility recycling
lines from learned word soup and acting out some gibberish auto generated scenario. 
In some ways WW3 did humanity a favor by shutting this nightmare manufacturer for good.
