Dream TV facility 
---------------------------
A pre WW3 facility that ran psychological experiments on the effects of AI
and viral marketing. Producing content from ming social media in hopes of 
creating content that is easy to market. In reality the content became 
darker and darker until it started resembling something out of the darkest
nightmares scaring young people and adults alike.

Abandonded semi automated android actors still roam the facility recycling
learned garbage and acting out some gibberish auto generated scenario. In some
ways WW3 did humanity a favor by shutting this nightmare manufacturer for good.
